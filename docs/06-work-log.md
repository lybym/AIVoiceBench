# Continuous work log

## 2026-09-06 — intake and Issue #1

- Verified user-pulled checkout at `12 CODE/AIVoiceBench`: clean `main`, commit `47a1865`, remote `git@github.com:lybym/AIVoiceBench.git`. GitHub connector confirms private repository and push/admin permission. Issue #1 is open and has no prior PR implementation. No CONTRIBUTING or test-methodology document existed; added both.
- Persisted complete handoff scope plus Windows executable/installer delivery and continuous GitHub synchronization requirements in `05-project-context.md`; aligned charter/architecture/roadmap.
- Branch: `issue-1-testcase-contract`. TestCase 2.0.0 introduces strict four-mode definitions, reusable frozen-audio/TTS/sample-silence segments, bounded interactive triggers, manifest provenance, reusable assertions and stable identity/version rules. Added contract validator/CLI, six synthetic fixtures and Windows/Linux CI.
- Validation: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — 26 tests passed. `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m aivoicebench validate examples/test-case.example.yaml examples/test-cases/asr.json examples/test-cases/latency.json examples/test-cases/barge-in.json examples/test-cases/context.json examples/test-cases/exploratory.json` — all six contract-valid. Python 3.12, jsonschema 4.26.0, PyYAML 6.0.3 in project `.venv`.
- Initial Python app alias was unusable; used bundled Python to create project venv. Package download required approved network access. Initial clone network failed; user completed checkout with SSH origin.
- Hardware/provider scope: no device playback/recording, microphone calibration, ASR/TTS/Judge call, executable packaging or real HIL run performed. Fixture manifests contain declared placeholders, not audio-ready assets.
- Next: commit/push/create PR for #1, then dependent #2 Timeline, #3 Metrics, #4 Finding/Evidence before runner #5. Record synchronization outcome below.
